## What makes happy life -- Robert Waldinger
``` 

What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where wouldyou put your time and your energy? There was a recent survey ofmillennials asking them what their most important life goalswere, and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for themwas to get rich. And another 50 percent of those same youngadults said that another major life goal was to become famous.

And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder andachieve more. We're given the impression that these are thethings that we need to go after in order to have a good life.Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and howthose choices work out for them, those pictures are almostimpossible to get. Most of what we know about human life weknow from asking people to remember the past, and as we know,hindsight is anything but 20/20. We forget vast amounts of whathappens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downrightcreative.

But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold throughtime? What if we could study people from the time that theywere teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keepspeople happy and healthy?

We did that. The Harvard Study of Adult Development may bethe longest study of adult life that's ever been done. For 75years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men, year after year, askingabout their work, their home lives, their health, and of courseasking all along the way without knowing how their life storieswere going to turn out.

Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of thiskind fall apart within a decade because too many people dropout of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or theresearchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves theball further down the field. But through a combination of luckand the persistence of several generations of researchers, thisstudy has survived. About 60 of our original 724 men are stillalive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s.

And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 childrenof these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study. Since 1938,we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first groupstarted in the study when they were sophomores at HarvardCollege. They all finished college during World War II, and thenmost went off to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorestneighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specificallybecause they were from some of the most troubled anddisadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. Most lived intenements, many without hot and cold running water.

When they entered the study, all of these teenagers wereinterviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to theirhomes and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagersgrew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They becamefactory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors, onePresident of the United States. Some developed alcoholism. Afew developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladderfrom the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made thatjourney in the opposite direction.

The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreamshave imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,telling you that the study still continues. Every two years, ourpatient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asksthem if we can send them yet one more set of questions abouttheir lives.

To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don't just send themquestionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We gettheir medical records from their doctors. We draw their blood, wescan their brains, we talk to their children. We videotape themtalking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when,about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would joinus as members of the study, many of the women said, "You know,it's about time."

So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come fromthe tens of thousands of pages of information that we'vegenerated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth orfame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that weget from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep ushappier and healthier. Period.

We've learned three big lessons about relationships. The first isthat social connections are really good for us, and that lonelinesskills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected tofamily, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physicallyhealthier, and they live longer than people who are less wellconnected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.People who are more isolated than they want to be from othersfind that they are less happy, their health declines earlier inmidlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they liveshorter lives than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact isthat at any given time, more than one in five Americans willreport that they're lonely.

And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can belonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned isthat it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's notwhether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's thequality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out thatliving in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High￾conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn outto be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.

 Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, theirmood stayed just as happy.

But the people who were in unhappy relationships, on the dayswhen they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by moreemotional pain. And the third big lesson that we learned aboutrelationships and our health is that good relationships don't justprotect our bodies, they protect our brains.关于婚姻和健康的关系， 我们得到的第三⼤结论是， 幸福的婚姻不单

It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship toanother person in your 80s is protective, that the people who arein relationships where they really feel they can count on the otherperson in times of need, those people's memories stay sharperlonger. And the people in relationships where they feel they reallycan't count on the other one, those are the people who experienceearlier memory decline. And those good relationships, they don'thave to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couplescould bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long asthey felt that they could really count on the other when the goinggot tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.

So this message, that good, close relationships are good for ourhealth and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? Well, we'rehuman. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can getthat'll make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationshipsare messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tendingto family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong.It never ends. The people in our 75-year study who were thehappiest in retirement were the people who had actively workedto replace workmates with new playmates. Just like themillennials in that recent survey, many of our men when theywere starting out as young adults really believed that fame andwealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after tohave a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years, our studyhas shown that the people who fared the best were the people wholeaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, withcommunity.

So what about you? Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.What might leaning in to relationships even look like?

Well, the possibilities are practically endless. It might besomething as simple as replacing screen time with people time orlivening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family memberwho you haven't spoken to in years, because those all-too-commonfamily feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold thegrudges.

I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. More than acentury ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this:"There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies,heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving,and but an instant, so to speak, for that."

The good life is built with good relationships.
