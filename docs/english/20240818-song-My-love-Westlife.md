## My love- Westlife
``` 
作词: NYLEN, PER HARRY，
作曲: NYLEN, PER HARRY，
An empty street, 
An empty house, 
A hole inside my heart, 
I'm all alone, 
The rooms are getting smaller, 
I wonder how, 
I wonder why, 
I wonder where they are, 
The days we had, 
The songs we sang together, 
Oh yeah, 
And  oh my love, 
I'm holding on forever, 
Reaching for a love that seems so far, 
So I say a little prayer, 
And hope my dreams will take me there, 
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love, 
Overseas from coast to coast, 
To find a place I love the most, 
Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love, 
I try to read, 
I go to work, 
I'm laughing with my friends, 
But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking, 
Oh no I wonder how, 
I wonder why, 
I wonder where they are, 
The days we had, 
The songs we sang together, 
Oh yeah And  oh my love, 
I'm holding on forever, 
Reaching for a love that seems so far, 
So I say a little prayer, 
And hope my dreams will take me there, 
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love, 
Over seas from coast to coast, 
To find a place I love the most, 
Where the fields are green to see you once again, 
To hold you in my arms, 
To promise you my love, 
To tell you from my heart, 
You're all I'm thinking of, 
I'm reaching for a love that seems so far, 
So I say a little prayer, 
And hope my dreams will take me there, 
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, my love, 
Over seas from coast to coast, 
To find a place I love the most, 
Where the fields are green to see you once again,my love, 
say a little prayer, 
dreams will take me there, 
Where the skies are blue to see you once again, 
Over seas from coast to coast, 
To find a place I love the most, 
Where the fields are green to see you once again,my love.
